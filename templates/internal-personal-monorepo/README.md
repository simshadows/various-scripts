# What is `internal-monorepo-template`?

In an internal setting (like for corporate jobs), I like to keep a personal monorepo of my own scripts and random stuff.

The contents of `internal-monorepo-template/src` is a "template repository". I create a new git repo, copy everything from `internal-monorepo-template/src` into the new repo, and this forms the initial commit.

I also regularly update the template with anything safe to publicly distribute.
