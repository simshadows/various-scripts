# utility-browser-extension-chrome

This is the Chrome extension that I use as a starting point for making utility Chrome extensions.

## How to install

STEP 1: Go to `chrome://extensions/`.

STEP 2: Enable *Developer mode* (in 2025, it's a toggle on the top-right).

STEP 3: Click *Load unpacked*, and select the `utility-browser-extension-chrome` folder.

You should have the extension installed now.
